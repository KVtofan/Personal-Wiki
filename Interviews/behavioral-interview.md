# Behavioral Interview

<details>
<summary>What is it?</summary>

A behavioral interview is a type of job interview that focuses on assessing a candidate's past behavior in order to predict their future performance. Instead of asking hypothetical questions, behavioral interviewers ask candidates to provide specific examples of how they have handled certain situations in the past.

The purpose of a behavioral interview is to evaluate a candidate's skills, abilities, and fit for a particular role based on their past experiences. By asking candidates to provide real-life examples, interviewers can gain insights into their problem-solving abilities, communication skills, teamwork, leadership potential, and more.

During a behavioral interview, candidates are typically asked to describe a situation, explain the actions they took, and discuss the results or outcomes of their actions. This approach allows interviewers to assess a candidate's ability to handle various work-related scenarios and make informed decisions.

Preparing for a behavioral interview involves reflecting on past experiences, identifying relevant examples, and practicing how to articulate those examples effectively. By showcasing your skills and experiences through well-crafted behavioral responses, you can increase your chances of impressing the interviewer and landing the job.

Remember, in a behavioral interview, it's important to be specific, provide context, and highlight your role and contributions in each situation. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your responses and ensure clarity and coherence.

## STAR method

> Note: The STAR method is a popular framework for structuring behavioral interview responses. It stands for **Situation**, **Task**, **Action**, and **Result**. By following this method, you can provide a clear and concise explanation of the situation, the task or challenge you faced, the actions you took to address it, and the results or outcomes you achieved. This helps interviewers understand your thought process, problem-solving skills, and the impact of your actions.

## Nugget First method 

> Nugget First means starting your response with a "nugget" that succinctly describes what your response will be about. \
> 
> For example:\
• Interviewer: "Tell me about a time you had to persuade a group of people to make a big change."\
• Candidate:"Sure, let me tell you about the time when I convinced my school to let undergraduates teach their own courses. Initially, my school had a rule where..."
