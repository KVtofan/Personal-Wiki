## SSH
*SSH* - It's a protocol (Secure Shell Protocol) for secure connection to remote server. When you connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine. The server will then check to see if the public key in your key file matches the one in your account. 
Public key is stored on the server, private key is stored on the client.
SSH is used to securely connect over unsecured network.
