# Array Search Algorithms

## Linear Search
- **Type:** Sequential search algorithm.
- **Complexity:** O(n) - linear time complexity.
- **Pros:** Simple and easy to implement.
- **Cons:** Inefficient for large arrays.

## Binary Search
- **Type:** Divide and conquer algorithm.
- **Complexity:** O(log n) - logarithmic time complexity.
- **Pros:** Efficient for sorted arrays.
- **Cons:** Requires a sorted array.

# Array Sorting Algorithms

## Merge Sort
- **Type:** Divide and conquer algorithm.
- **Complexity:** O(n log n) - logarithmic time complexity.
- **Pros:** Efficient for large arrays.
- **Cons:** Requires additional memory space.

## Quick Sort
- **Type:** Divide and conquer algorithm.
