# HTTP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the TCP/IP based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. HTTP follows a classical “Client-Server model” with a client opening a connection request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, that means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.
