# Authentication

1. ### Basic Authentication
    - **How it Works**: Basic Authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol. It transmits credentials as user ID/password pairs, encoded with Base64, within an HTTP header.
    - Use Cases: It's suitable for simple, internal applications or for initial development phases. However, due to its less secure nature (as credentials are sent with each request), it's not recommended for production environments without HTTPS.

2. ### Session-Based Authentication
    - **How it Works**: In session-based authentication, the server creates a session for the user after the user logs in. The session ID is then stored on the client side, typically in a cookie, and is used to track the user for each request.
    - **Use Cases**: This strategy is widely used in web applications. It is well-suited for applications that require the server to maintain the user state.

3. ### Token-Based Authentication
    - **How it Works**: Token-based authentication secures the communication between client and server by exchanging a token (often generated using secure algorithms) instead of the user credentials. After login, the server generates a token that the client uses in subsequent requests.
    - **Use Cases**: It's commonly used in single page applications (SPAs), mobile apps, and for API authentication, offering benefits like scalability and mobile friendliness.

4. ### JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Authentication
    - **How it Works**: JWT is a type of token-based authentication. It uses JSON Web Tokens, which are compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims can be verified and trusted because they are digitally signed.
    - **Use Cases**: JWT is suitable for distributed microservices architecture and single sign-on (SSO) scenarios, providing a way to securely transmit information between parties.

5. ### OAuth
    - **How it Works**: OAuth is an open standard for access delegation commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.
    - **Use Cases**: OAuth is extensively used for token-based authentication in third-party access, allowing services to communicate and share information securely without revealing user passwords (e.g., "Login with Google/Facebook").

6. ### SSO (Single Sign-On)
    - **How it Works**: SSO is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. This is achieved by centralizing the authentication mechanism.
    - **Use Cases**: SSO is ideal for enterprises and large organizations with multiple applications and services, simplifying the user experience and improving security by reducing password fatigue.
